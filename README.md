#### Why [Highlight.js][4] ?
Recently, I determine to turn to use **Markdown** to write blog. But here is a problem, I use [SyntaxHighlighter][5] before and I'm  failed to find a tool to support [SyntaxHighlighter][5] and markdown very well. But with [Highlight.js][4] it's very easy.

There is a web markdown editor named **StackEdit** you can use to write markdown and publish to Github, Wordpress, Blog and etc. or export it to html. It allow you to write code like what you do in github but it's more powerful. Especially , it has [Highlight.js][4] and [Prettify][6] plugin to highlight codes. Or you can disable code highlight and it will use **&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;** to wrap codes. This also can be used by [Highlight.js][4].

If you would like to just use vim, emacs or other text editor. There is also a tool named [**Pandoc**][8] that you can use to convert markdown to many formats. with option --no-highlight, it will also use **&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;** to wrap codes.

#### Start to write a plugin
There is already a plugin named [wp-highlight.js][2] which can be used in [Wordpress][3]. But it load the full version of [Highlight.js][4]. It cost too much data traffic(*about 180+KB*). It will slow down loading time and I really don't need so many languages(especially some of them I have never heard of). I don't want to pay for it. So I need a plugin to load just the languages I need, or download [Highlight.js][4] from public CDN.

At the same time, I wrote many blogs before and using [SyntaxHighlighter][5] for years, I do not want to fix my codes that already puhlished. So I need a plugin to convert those code automaticly.

Then this plugin starts. It allow user only load common package of [Highlight.js][4] (*only 30-40KB*) or extended package(*about 60-70KB*). It also can analysis doms on web page, find codes in [SyntaxHighlighter][5] format or [Prettify][6] format, and then turn them into [Highlight.js][4] format, and finally , highlight them.
